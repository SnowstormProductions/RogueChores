This Is A Small Android App I Made Because Keeping Track Of Chores Became More Of A Hastle Then It Needed To Be, So I Made Rouge Chores

If You Want To Download It, The Downloads Are In The Releases Tab To The Right Of The Main Page

To Use It, Simply Install, Modify The Chores Json File, It Is Formatted Like This
the days are 0-6 monday-sunday
do not change dateMarkedOff, lastSwapped, or markedOff

{
  "chores": [
    {
      "dateMarkedOff": "",
      "days": [
        0,
        1,
        2,
        3,
        4,
        5,
        6
      ],
      "description": "Description",
      "id": "chore1",
      "isSwapVisible": false,
      "lastSwapped": "",
      "markedOff": false,
      "mode": "repeat",
      "title": "Title"
    },
    {
      "dateMarkedOff": "",
      "days": [
        0,
        1,
        2,
        3,
        4,
        5,
        6
      ],
      "description": "Description",
      "id": "chore2",
      "isSwapVisible": false,
      "lastSwapped": "",
      "markedOff": false,
      "mode": "repeat",
      "title": "Title"
    }
  ]
}

This android application is almost 100% AI due to this being a side project I just wanted to work to track chores.
Because it is almost 100% AI, I do not claim this android application as my own, but will update in case of issues with how it works or suggestions.
