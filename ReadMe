This Is A Small Android App I Made Because Keeping Track Of Chores Became More Of A Hastle Then It Needed To Be, So I Made Rouge Chores

If You Want To Download It, The Downloads Are In The Releases Tab To The Right Of The Main Page

To Use It, Simply Install, Change The Chores Json File, It Is Formatted Like This
the days are 0-6 monday-sunday
